How It Works
The app interface is split into three main sections:

- Top: Timer frame to track focused sessions.
- Left: Notes frame for writing and storing text notes.
- Right: Divided into two parts:

To-do list for managing tasks.

Current Status
Core UI components and interactions are implemented and functional.
Saving and loading of timer state, notes, and to-do list data are planned but not yet complete — data persistence is currently limited.
Visual design is minimal and unpolished since this is primarily a learning project focused on functionality rather than appearance.
