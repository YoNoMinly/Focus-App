# Focus-App
A simple Tkinter-based productivity app featuring a timer, notes, to-do list, and weather panel with basic visual effects. Users can switch between dark and light themes.  Currently, core functions work, but data saving/loading is incomplete, so notes and tasks donâ€™t persist yet.  This is a basic learning project with minimal design and UI polish.
